# Introduction
The goal of this project is to make a secure (or at least secure within a reasonable amount of effort) Windows 10 Home installation to ensure a secure environment to consume and produce content. It is possible that by gaining new insights hardening-options are either removed or added.

My other goal is to gain a good understanding on Windows 10 Hardening and other Security-related aspects. I feel that as a Lead Information Security Officer it is important to upkeep (general) knowledge about Technology and it's Security.

## The Scope
Scope is an important part for this project. Otherwise you can endlessly install security tools and solutions which in the end have a trade-off. This might be resources and performance, but also your own precious time to keep it running :).

The constraints are:
- Windows 10 Home and up (sorry, not going to focus on Windows 8.1 and lower)
- For the larger part, the settings needs to be able to be set through a GUI. I'll make some exceptions here and there (because there was never a GUI and it's impact is rather important).
- Settings must be able to be set without using Group Policy Object (GPO), because that is not present (by default) on Windows 10 Home.

## The Software
- Windows 10 Home - Creators Update
- Build ?
- Date ?
